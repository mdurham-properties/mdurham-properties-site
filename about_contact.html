      <h2>About M.Durham Properties and Rentals</h2>
      <p>At M.Durham Properties and Rentals, we understand that real estate is more than just buying or renting — it’s about security, comfort, and finding a place to truly call home.</p>
      <p>Our company was founded with one simple mission: to help individuals and families find safe, affordable housing solutions in a market that often overlooks them. With deep knowledge of the local community and a heart-driven approach, we’re committed to delivering value through transparency, empathy, and a personalized experience every step of the way.</p>

      <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Milo Durham</strong>. My journey into real estate wasn’t born out of opportunity — it was born out of hardship.</p>
      <p>Growing up, my parents struggled with housing, and I saw firsthand how unstable living conditions can affect a family. That personal experience became my motivation. I knew then that if I ever had the chance, I’d do something to change that for others.</p>
      <p>Today, M.Durham Properties and Rentals is the result of that mission. I’m proud to help others find homes where they can finally feel settled, safe, and seen.</p>
